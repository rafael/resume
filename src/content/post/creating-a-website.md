## Creating a website in 2024

I haven't created or hosted a website in a very long time. I've used squarespace and wix in the past to quickly create websites. My wife asked my today if there are options she could use today that would enable her to create her website and that don't require a subscription. Quick look at some of the options out there, most of them require you to pay if you want a custom domain. 

So I did a small research and ran into astro. Looked that there are some cool templates that you can pay (or in this case use for free). 

After a few clicks here and there, I decided to give Astro a try. Looked that there are some nice templates and I forked [srleon](https://github.com/srleom/astro-theme-resume) theme for resumes.
 
Literally within minutes I was able to get this forked deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Then most of the time was doing small tweaks to the content. 

First time in many years that I don't have a personal website... My wife one coming soon next.
